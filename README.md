# Hangman Game (Java Swing)

This project is a simple **Hangman game** implemented in Java using **Swing** for the user interface. Players can guess letters to uncover a secret word, with visual feedback provided through a Hangman image that progresses with incorrect guesses.

---

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** using Java Swing.
- Enter guesses via a text field and submit button (or press ENTER).
- Dynamic Hangman images update with each incorrect guess.
- Input validation ensures only single alphabet letters are accepted.
- End-of-game pop-ups announce **win** or **loss**.
- Fully modular logic separated from the UI for maintainability.
